# 2DEndlessRunnerGame

This is a prototype Endless Runner game made in Unreal.  All mechanics are written in C++.  

Player must avoid obstacles by jumping over them.  The longer the player survives, the larger score they receive.  

Game is set up where the player isn't actually moving, the platforms and obstacles spawn and move toward the player.
